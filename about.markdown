# About The Author

I'm matt urbanski, a sysadmin/developer interested in (very often functional) programming, juggling, photography, and all the electronic music I can handle. 

Professionally, I am a sysadmin with a deep interest in programming. I've worked in a few interesting places, but you can see all that in my (infrequently updated) [linkedin][3]

# About This Site

iflowfor8hours is a [jekyll][4] based blog.
The blog compiles into pure HTML. No javascript (keeping it simple). Ultra-fast and light. No database. It's hosted on 
[Quickweb][2]. So far, I haven't had any problems with them, which is more than I can say about a lot of hosting companies. They were the cheapest European host I could find on [lowendbox][5] at the time I was looking for hosting.
