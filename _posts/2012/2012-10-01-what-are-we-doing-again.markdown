title: What are we doing again?

Recently I've been reading and thinking quite a bit about what 'we' as developers are really doing, or attempting to accomplish. I'm sure this has happened to tons of other people and it's gone away or gotten worse, depending on the individual. 
I'm think I'm done trying to make money. It's has proved to be pretty easy, and I don't want to be wealthy, or own things I can't afford, or go on trips that I can't pay for. So now what? 
The solution for me is to strive for excellence in everything I do, and to attempt to help people at the same time. I think this is my future.
