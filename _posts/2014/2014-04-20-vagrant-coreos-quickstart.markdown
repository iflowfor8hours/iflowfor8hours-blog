title: Vagrant, Jenkins, and CoreOS quickstart

I recently started exploring how to allow teams to self service their own infrastructure for jenkins. What I mean by this is somehow allowing them to spin up new nodes whenever they wanted to by just including some metadata about their projects, and then pushing to git and having some automation take care of the rest. 

I don't have a full solution worked out yet, but I used this as an excuse to play with docker and CoreOS. 

These are just preliminary notes, I will post more on how successful I am when I get something more solid in place.

Check out the [repo](https://github.com/iflowfor8hours/coreos-jenkins-spike) for more details.
