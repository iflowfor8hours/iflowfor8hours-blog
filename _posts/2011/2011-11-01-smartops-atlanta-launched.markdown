I'm proud to announce that a friend and I have gotten our act together and launched [SmartOps Atlanta](http://smartopsatlanta.org). I plan on running a few training sessions on things that I know about that will make the lives of devops badasses easier and happier. We're running our first training session in 2 weeks, you can register for it on our [eventbrite page](http://smartopspuppet.eventbrite.com). I look forward to seeing everyone there. There will be free pizza courtesy of puppet labs and they might send a few copies of pro puppet as well.
