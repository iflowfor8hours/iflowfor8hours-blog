title: Changed my blog to Jekyll
layout: post
---

When nanoc3 was updated from 3.1.6 to 3.2.x, it broke some of my templates, and I was itching for a change anyway, so here we are again. New blog. Hopefully I'm more motivated to post now that everything works conveniently again. I still have to get tags working, but other than that, I think I'm set. Also, I have to test out commenting and make sure my google analytics are still the same.
I started 2 new jobs that should lead to more interesting posts, centered around puppet and mcollective, as they are a big part of my responsibilities at the moment.
