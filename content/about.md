# About The Author

I'm matt urbanski, I'm interested in (very often functional) programming, juggling, photography, and all the electronic music I can handle. 

Professionally, I am a sysadmin with a deep interest in programming. I've worked in a few interesting places, but you can see all that in my (infrequently updated) [linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/matthew-urbanski/5/449/332).
