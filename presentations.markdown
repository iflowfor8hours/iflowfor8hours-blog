This serves as a repository of presentations and talks I've given in the past at various users' groups and conferences. 

### [Short puppet talk](http://www.iflowfor8hours.info/presentations/shortpuppet.html)

A very short, basic intro to puppet and some of it's cooler features. Built with landslide, an awesome js slideshow library.
 
### [Puppet bootcamp presentation](http://www.iflowfor8hours.info/presentations/puppetbootcamp.html)

Some overlap with the short puppet talk, but more hands-on. I made this for a bootcamp I gave at smartopsatlanta. Also built with landslide.

### [Practical Vagrant](https://slid.es/urbanskims/scrum-gathering-vagrant)

Quick introduction to using vagrant that I gave at the 2013 South Africa Scrum Gathering. There is a [github repo](https://github.com/iflowfor8hours/vagrant-tutorial) for the practical part.

### [Process Isolation: Containers, Chroots, and Virtualization](http://slid.es/urbanskims/vmprimer)

Internal presentation that I gave to my coworkers about different kinds of virualization and how they work. Notes are [in a gist](https://gist.github.com/iflowfor8hours/7300262), and the presentation is difficult to follow without them.
