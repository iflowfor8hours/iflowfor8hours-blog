This serves as a repository of presentations and talks I've given in the past at various users' groups and conferences. 

### [Short puppet talk](http://www.iflowfor8hours.info/presentations/shortpuppet.html)

A very short, basic intro to puppet and some of it's cooler features. Built with landslide, an awesome js slideshow library.
 
### [Puppet bootcamp presentation](http://www.iflowfor8hours.info/presentations/puppetbootcamp.html)

Some overlap with the short puppet talk, but more hands-on. I made this for a bootcamp I gave at smartopsatlanta. Also built with landslide.
